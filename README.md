Week 2
    Sections 1.0 to 1.1
        First section was the installation section and it was very simple to do.  I have worked with android studios before so I already had it installed.
        The first part was to create an empty project that would use kotlin and the API choosen was API 19 KitKat because apps created on this version
        would be able to run on 95.3% of devices.
        I have also learned to create an Android emulator, for this section we will be using the Nexus 5x for the virtual emulator.  With API level 28
        also named Pie.
